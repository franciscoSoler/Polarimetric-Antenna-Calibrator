% -- inputs -- %
% power -> is the output power of the central electornics.
% steerAngle -> the steering angle of the beam (i need this parameter in order
% to obtain the correction values of the attenuators and phase shifters); 
% This can be the input for other function (the one that receives the phase 
% and power delta too)


% -- outputs -- %
% phase array regarding each TRM, this parameter is the phase shift of the 
% ideal signal transmitted in which the steering angle is 0 degrees.
% gain power array regarding each TRM, this parameter is the percentage of the
% ideal power transmitted in which the steering angle is 0 degrees.



% -- functionality of this script -- %
% This function must determine the power and phase  of each TRM, the process 
% to obtain this is 
%	in the first stage, a lot of calculations must be performed, the component
%	map must be determined, is it another input? 

phInput = 0;
powerInput = 0; % in dBm

% For the coupling must i have a matrix of posible TRM
% determine the possible paths.
% determine the different step of each TRm




%%%%%%%% ----------- First Stage ---------- %%%%%%%%%%%
% only one pannel, twenty antennas, i could use less than that.

now what?? 
i must enter the inputs and get the outputs....
and the outputs are
